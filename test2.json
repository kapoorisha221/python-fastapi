Thank God you are fully under your command, please how can I help you? I'm supposed to be standing on my line because I have a bill, but I run it 24 hours, and I don't want to work. Okay, okay, just a moment, I have the same number. The same number you gave me from. Yes, the same number, okay? Well, and the calls are okay? Their work? Are you okay? No, it's all locked? Walk a moment with me. But with your permission, of course, go ahead.  Ok, your presence with me? Uh, Maaya exists. Could I just ask your permission, do we make flight mode okay? Now, the first thing that is closed with you is that I will take a procedure through me, and you will work, but the flight mode for 10 seconds, the first time I close with you, I will take the procedure, and after that, I will contact you again. Should I confirm this well with you or not?  At a time? Surely anything else? No, don't deliver me under your command, you honored me with the request and then goodbye."
